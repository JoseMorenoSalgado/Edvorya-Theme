 * Version details for theme_edvorya.
 *
 * Alpha.28 makes configurable branding truthful and enforceable. A new static
 * audit verifies that every exposed colour setting is emitted through Moodle's
 * cached CSS pipeline, has a canonical default and has at least one semantic
 * CSS consumer. The obsolete accent setting/token is removed end-to-end and
 * cleaned from legacy alpha configuration during upgrade. This release marker
 * also anchors full regression validation to the final alpha.28 source state.
