 * Version details for theme_edvorya.
 *
 * Alpha.29 removes historical visual duplication from learning-support and
 * operational experience modules. Those modules now focus on containment,
 * scrolling, table geometry, administration forms and message-app layout,
 * while identity.css remains the final Edvorya LMS visual composition layer.
 * The cleanup removes 164 obsolete source CSS lines without replacing Core
 * Moodle behavior or data-region contracts.
